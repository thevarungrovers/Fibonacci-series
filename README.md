# Fibonacci Series
0 1 1 2 3 5 8 .....

#Challenge
The challenge was to create a program to print the Fibonacci series

#How it Works
- First, it takes input from the user to get the number of digits to be printed
- It, then, checks whether it is zero, negative or positive and works accordingly.
- After this, it checks that if 1 or 2 is entered or not as the first 2 numbers in a Fibonacci series are the base for the rest of the series or we can say these are constant.
- Then, it loops over the given number to create and print the corresponding numbers of a series.

#About Fibonacci series
- In simple words, it is the sum of two last corresponding numbers.
- e.g. 0 1 1
       	   ^ 
	   this number '1' is obtained by adding 0 and 1.
  Similarly,
      0 1 1 2 3
	      ^
	      this number '3' is obtained by adding 2 and 1.
